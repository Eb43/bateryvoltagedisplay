BatteryVoltageDisplay shows Android phone’s real-time battery voltage. The information is always visible in an icon in the status bar and in a notification, even while you use other apps.

Practical uses of monitoring battery voltage:

    🔋 Check battery real health
       Spot signs of battery degradation. Watch for sudden or irregular voltage drops—these are early signs that the battery is degrading.

    🔌 Catch bad chargers or cables
       During charging, voltage should rise smoothly (e.g., 3.7 V → 4.2 V). If it stays flat or jumps irregularly, the cable or adapter is likely defective.

    💀 Avoid unexpected shutdowns
       Monitoring voltage lets you see the exact point where the phone shuts down from low battery. Helping you avoid surprises like the device shutting down at 30% charge.

    📈 Save money on unnecessary battery replacement
       Monitor battery’s voltage to know its true health and decide a battery replacement only when it is actually needed.

    ⚠️ Prolong battery lifespan
       Batteries experience high stress when charged to their maximum voltage, which often happens before the charge indicator shows 100%. By monitoring voltage, you can unplug your phone at the optimal point to reduce stress and extend battery life.

    🔎 Evaluate aftermarket replacement battery capacity
       Quickly know a replacement battery’s quaity. A good battery holds stable voltage under load, while a poor-quality battery drops quickly under use and spikes sharply when charging.


The Battery Voltage Display app is a tool for anyone who wants detailed insights into their Android smartphone’s battery health.
